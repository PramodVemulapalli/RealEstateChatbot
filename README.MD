The above code pertains to the flask server deployed in Heroku:



*   Connectivity to Google dialogflow is implemented in index.py
    *   The webhook() function handles two possible calls from dialogflow, one to fetch a house and another to answer a question. 
*   Connectivity to zillow is implemented in gethomes.py which handles the two calls from dialog flow
    *   1) Has a function getresult() which scrapes search results from zillow by encoding zipcode, max price, and bedrooms in a url and returns a single result link.  
    *   2) Has a function getreply() which takes a specific result link and a string and scrapes zillow for all the details about the house in the link such as bedrooms, bathrooms, roof, architecture type, lot size, etc and then returns a reply based on the input string.
